## Question
This question was asked by: Tesla

Suppose there exists a new airline named Jetco flies domestically across North America. Jetco recently had a study commissioned that tested the boarding time of every airline and it came out that Jetco had the fastest average boarding times of any airline.

What factors could have biased this result and what would you look into?

<!-- ## Solution
Solving for this problem means we have to look at the problem set holistically.
* What assumptions are being made?
* What is being left out of the problem statement?
* What is in the problem statement that we can use to hint towards reasonings behind a potential flawed study?

Usually the factors that bias a test are within the set up of the tests themselves. In this case we are comparing, Jetco, to different competing airlines.

Let's look at one of the parts where the question prompt states that Jetco **flies domestically across North America**. If Jetco only flies domestic, it would result in much shorter flights than airlines like Delta or United that fly internationally, which means much more passengers on average for each flight. If we calculate the **average boarding time per passenger**, it can determine if boarding times are shorter because the actual flights have less passenger on Jetco or if the boarding time on a per passenger basis is actually shorter.

What about the time it takes for a passenger to board with a carry-on suitcase versus a passenger with just a small bag? If Jetco only allowed customers to carry on one small item or added fees for additional luggage, this would create less customers with added baggage which would decrease the overall boarding time. A metric to measure here would then be comparing the **average boarding time per passenger per bag**. If this number is equivalent to other airlines, then we can determine that Jetco may have less carry-ons on average than other airline companies.

Lastly what if Jetco moved more of the logistic processes higher in the airport funnel. An example is having the ticketing process all moved towards the gate and security and not before boarding. That way the total amount of time is still the same, just shifted upwards. We could analyze the total time spent from arriving at the airport to seat boarding time to figure out if Jetco actually has a faster overall process. -->
