Imagine a deck of 500 cards numbered from 1 to 500. If all the cards are shuffled randomly and you are asked to pick three cards, one at a time, what's the probability of each subsequent card being larger than the previous drawn card?

<!-- ## Solution
Imagine this as a sample space problem ignoring all other distracting details. If you have to draw three different numbered cards without replacement, and they are all unique, then we are assuming that there will be effectively a lowest card, a middle card, and a high card.

Let's make it easy and assume we drew the numbers 1,2, and 3. In our scenario, if we drew (1,2,3), then that would be the winning scenario. But what's the full range of outcomes we could draw? Let's map out all of the possibilities.

(3,2,1)
(3,1,2)
(2,1,3)
(2,3,1)
(1,3,2)
(1,2,3)

So six possibilities in the total sample space. And only one of them is the partition that we want. Given this, the answer is 1/6.

The trick is to not be distracted by the size of the population. The population does not matter if you are looking at the order within the sample. -->
