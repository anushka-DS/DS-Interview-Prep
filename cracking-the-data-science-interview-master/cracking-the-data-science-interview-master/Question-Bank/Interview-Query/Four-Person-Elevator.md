## Question
This question was asked by: Postmates

There are four people on the ground floor of a building that has five levels not including the ground floor. They all get into the same elevator.

If each person is equally likely to get on any floor and they leave independently of each other, what is the probability that no two passengers will get off at the same floor?

<!-- ## Solution
The number of ways to assigning five floors to four different people is to get the total sample space. In this case it would be 5 * 5 * 5 * 5. For each person, they can choose one of five floors, which happens four times for four people. So the total number of combinations is 5^4.

The number of ways to assign five floors to four people without repetition of floors is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 because for the first passenger you have five different options. The second person has four, and so on. Note that this number counts all possible orders betwen passengers as well.

The result is then 5/5 * 4/5 * 3/5 * 2/5 = 0.192 -->
