## Problem

Suppose you enter an ice cream store. They sell two types of ice cream: soft serve and frozen yogurt. Additionally, there are 10 flavors of soft serve and 13 flavors of frozen yogurt. You're really hungry, so you decide you can order and eat two ice creams before they melt, but are facing some decision fatigue given the amount of choices. How many ways are there to choose exactly two ice creams from the store? Figuring this out should help quantify that decision fatigue.

<!-- ## Solution

Since we haven't specified what kind of ice creams we pick, we can choose any ice cream (flavor or type) for our first pick, which gives us options. For our second choice, we then have 22 unique ice creams left to choose from.

Using [rule of product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_product), there are 23 * 22 = 506 possible ways to choose exactly two ice creams.

However, we have counted every ice cream combination twice. For example, (A,B) and (B,A) are counted as two different choices even when we have selected the same two ice creams. So, the correct number of possible ways are 506/2 = 253. -->
