## Question
Suppose you're consulting for a school district, and the head of the school district thinks the students have above average intelligence. A random sample of thirty students have a mean IQ score of 112. Is there sufficient evidence to support the head's claim?

You can assume the mean IQ score across the population of all students (e.g. including students outside the head's school district) is 100, with a standard deviation of 15.

<!-- ## Solution
The first thing we should recognize is that this question is asking us to use the hypothesis testing framework. Some key clues are: (1) we're trying to get "evidence" to support a claim, (2) given numbers are the population mean and standard deviation, alongside the claim's mean. The steps below outline how to use the hypothesis testing framework.

1. **Null and alternative hypothesis**: We're going to state the null and alternate hypothesis. The population mean IQ score is the null hypothesis, because that is what we're comparing the claim against, so H0: μ=100.
The head's claim that the students at his school have above average IQ scores, so we are looking for scores greater than our mean population IQ score, this indicates we're going to be doing a one-tailed test. Additionally, since the head is claiming the students in his district have an above average IQ, and the average across *all* students is 100, we can define his claim (our alternative hypothesis) as H1: μ > 100.
2. **Alpha score and rejection region area**: Since we're not given an alpha level, we're going to use 5% or alpha = 0.05. Next, we're going to find the rejection region area by using a [z-table](http://users.stat.ufl.edu/~athienit/Tables/Ztable.pdf). An area of 0.05 is equivalent to a z-score of 1.645.
3. **Calculate the test statistic**: Using the z-score formula, z = (x – μ) / σ, we are going to calculate the z-score. With the given data: z = (112.5-100) / (15/√30)=4.56.
4. **Evaluate**: Since our z-score in step 3 is greater than our defined threshold in step 2, (4.56 > 1.645), we can reject the null hypothesis, and accept the alternative hypothesis. We can conclude we have enough evidence to support the head's claim. Additionally, we could frame this up in terms of a p-value. The z-score of our test statistic is 4.56 -- the associated p-value is < 0.00001 [using an [online calculator](https://www.socscistatistics.com/pvalues/normaldistribution.aspx)]. Given this is less than our significance threshold of 0.05 we can again conclude that the null hypothesis should be rejected and the head's students do indeed have above average intelligence relative to all students.

*Note: In an interview you probably will not be asked to run through a formal hypothesis test question like the one above, but you should be familiar with setting up the correct framework behind a hypothesis test and applying it to business problems.* -->
