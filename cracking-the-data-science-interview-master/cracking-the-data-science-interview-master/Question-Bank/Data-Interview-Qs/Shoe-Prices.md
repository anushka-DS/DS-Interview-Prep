## Problem
Suppose you are given a SQL table containing the brands of shoes (field name: brand) as well as the shoe price (field name: price). The database is called shoe_info. You are tasked with updating the prices in this database for a few brands of shoes. Specifically, you have been asked to update all Nike shoe prices to $100, and all Adidas shoe prices to $85. Using SQL, write a query to perform this action.

<!-- ## Solution
This question is super straightforward and can be completed with the UPDATE function in SQL. See below for the syntax, and remember that this function exists, as some interviewers may ask questions requiring knowledge of it!

```
# here we can execute this with a couple of UPDATE statements
UPDATE shoe_info
SET price = 100
WHERE brand = 'Nike'

UPDATE shoe_info
SET price = 85
WHERE brand = 'Adidas'
``` -->
