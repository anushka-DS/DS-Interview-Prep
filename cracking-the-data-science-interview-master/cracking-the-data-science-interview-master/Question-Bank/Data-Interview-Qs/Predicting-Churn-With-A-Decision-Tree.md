## Problem
Given the following [dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erood/interviewqs.com_code_snippets/master/Datasets/teleco_user_data.csv), can you create a decision tree to predict customer churn? For simplicity, you can set the maximum depth of the decision tree to 4. For the purpose of this exercise, you do not need to optimize the model.

Solution will create a model and decision tree using Python, then discuss interpreting the output.
