## Problem
A given car has a number of miles it can run before its battery is depleted, where the number of miles are exponentially distributed with an average of 10,000 miles to depletion.

If a given individual needs to make a trip that's 3,000 miles, what is the probability that she/he will be able to complete the trip without having to replace the battery? You can assume the car battery is new for this problem.

<!-- ## Solution:

This one isn't too bad but might require brushing up on exponential distribution. If we look at the link provided above, you'll see there's a proof on the bottom of the page that we can use to solve this: `P(X > x) =  e^{-(\lambda x)}`, where here x = the miles we'll drive (3,000) and Î» = is the mean as a rate (e.g. 1/10,000). If we plug these values in, we'll be able to find the probability!

```
P(X > x) =  e^{-(\lambda x)}
P(X > 3000) =  e^{-(3000/10000)}
P(X > 3000) \approx  0.7408
