## Problem
This problem was asked by Uber.

You’re on the data science team and are responsible for figuring out surge pricing. Why does it need to exist and what metrics and data should you track?

## Solution
Surge pricing is a phenomenon because of supply and demand imbalance - either there may be a lack of drivers, or excess riders. Therefore, surge pricing exists to a) entice more drivers to use the app, and b) reduce demand by increasing prices for riders. Managing supply and demand is bottom-line critical to Uber’s business, so surge pricing needs to exist.

Possible metrics to track (there are many) could be things including: number of active drivers, number of requested rides, and gains in revenue. It is quite likely that price elasticities vary by city, type of ride, etc. so it would be important to track all of that data on a ride by ride basis when making surge pricing algorithms.
