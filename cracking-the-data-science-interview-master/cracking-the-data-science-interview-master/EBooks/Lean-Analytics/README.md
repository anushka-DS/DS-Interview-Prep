## We Are All Liars

- Instincts are experiments. Data is proof.
- Lean analytical thinking is about asking the right questions and focusing on the one key metric that will produce the change you are after.

## How To Keep Score

- [Good Metric](#good-metric)
- [Testing](#testing)

### Good Metric

Rules of thumb for a good metric:
- A good metric is comparative.
- A good metric is understandable.
- A good metric is a ratio or a rate.
- A good metric change the way you behave.

**Qualitative Versus Quantitative Metrics**

- Quantitative data is easy to understand. It is nice and scientific, and you can aggregate it, extrapolate it, and put it into a spreadsheet.
- Qualitative data is messy, subjective, and imprecise. It's the stuff of interviews and debates. It's hard to quantify.

**Vanity Versus Real Metrics**

Avoid these 8 vanity metrics:
- Number of hits.
- Number of page views.
- Number of visits.
- Number of unique visitors.
- Number of followers/friends/likes.
- Time on site / number of pages.
- Emails collected.
- Number of downloads.

**Exploratory Versus Reporting Metrics**

- Analytics can check our facts and assumptions to be sure we are not kidding ourselves, and check that our business plans are accurate.
- Analytics can test our intuitions, turning hypotheses into evidence.
- Analytics can provide the data for our spreadsheets, waterfall charts, and board meetings.
- Analytics can help us find the nugget of opportunity on which to build a business.

**Leading Versus Lagging Metrics**

- A leading metric (*current number of sales prospects*) tries to predict the future. A lagging metric (*churn*) gives you an indication that there's a problem.
- In the early days of your startup, you won't have enough data to know how a current metric relates to one down the road, so measure lagging metrics at first.
  - Lagging metrics are useful and can provide a solid baseline of performance.
  - For leading metrics to work, you need to be able to do cohort analysis and compare groups of customers over periods of time.

**Correlated Versus Causal Metrics**

- Correlation is good. Causality is great.
- Sometimes, you may have to settle for the former - but you should always be trying to discover the latter.

### Testing

- Testing usually involves comparing two things against each other through segmentation, cohort analysis, or A/B testing.
- A **segment** is simply a group that shares some common characteristic. Segmentation works for any industry and any form of marketing, not just for websites.
- Each group of users is a **cohort** - participants in an experiment across their lifecycle. You can compare cohorts against one another to see if, on the whole, key metrics are getting better over time.
- When we compare one attribute of a subject's experience and assume everything else is equal, we are doing **A/B testing**.
- **Multivariate analysis** includes analyzing multiple tests at once to see which correlates strongly with an improvement in a key metric.

## What To Do With Your Life

### The Lean Canvas

The Lean Canvas is fantastic at identifying the areas of biggest risk and enforcing intellectual honesty. Consider the following:
1. **Problem**: Have you identified real problems people know they have?
2. **Customer Segments**: Do you know your target markets? Do you know how to target messages to them as distinct groups?
3. **Unique Value Proposition**: Have you found a clear, distinctive, memorable way to explain why you're better or different?
4. **Solution**: Can you solve the problems in the right way?
5. **Channels**: How will you get your product or service to your customers, and their money back to you?
6. **Revenue Streams**: Where will the money come from? Will it be one-time or recurring? The result of a direct transaction or something indirect?
7. **Cost Structure**: What are the direct, variable, and indirect costs you'll have to pay for when you run the business?
8. **Metrics**: Do you know what numbers to track to understand if you're making progress?
9. **Unfair advantage**: What is the "force multiplier" that will make your efforts have greater impact than your competitors?

### What To Work On
- If you want to do something and are good at it, but can't be paid to do it, *learn to monetize*.
- If you are good at something and can be paid to do it, but don't like doing it, *learn to say no*.
- If you like to do something and can be paid to do it, but aren't very good at it, *learn to do it well*.

## Data Driven and Data Informed

- Lean Startup is focused on learning above everything else, and encourages broad thinking, exploration, and experimentation.
- Lean Startup helps expand your vision, because you're encouraged to question everything.

[back to top](#lean-analytics)

## Analytics Frameworks

1. **Empathy**: I've found a real, poorly met need a reachable market faces.
2. **Stickiness**: I've figured out how to solve the problem in a way they will accept and pay for.
3. **Virality**: I've built the right product/features/functionality that keeps users around.
4. **Revenue**: The users and features fuel growth organically and artificially.
5. **Scale**: I've found a sustainable, scalable business with the right margins in a healthy ecosystem.
-> I can achieve a successful exit for the right terms.

## One Metric That Matters

The One Metric That Matters is the one number you are completely focused on above everything else for your current stage.
- It answers the most important question you have.
- It forces you to draw a line in the sand and have clear goals.
- It focuses the entire company.
- It inspires a culture of experimentation.

## Business Models

Business growth comes from improving one of these five "knobs":
- **More stuff** means adding products or services, preferably those you know your customers want so you don't waste time building things they won't use or buy.
- **More people** means adding users, ideally through virality or word of mouth, but also through paid advertising. The best way to add users is when it's an integral part of product use since this happens automatically and implies an endorsement from the inviting user.
- **More often** means stickiness, reduced churn, and repeated use. Early on, stickiness tends to be a key knob on which to focus, because until your core early adopters find your product superb, it's unlikely you can achieve good viral marketing.
- **More money** means upselling and maximizing the price users will pay, or the revenue from ad clicks, or the amount of content they create, or the number of in-game purchases they make.
- **More efficiently**  means reducing the cost of delivering and supporting your service, but also lowering the cost of customer acquisition by doing less paid advertising and more word of mouth.

The 5 aspects of any business model:
1. **Acquisition channel**: How the visitor, customer, or user finds out about the startup.
  - Paid advertising
  - Search engine management
  - Social media outreach
  - Inherent and artificial virality
  - Affiliate marketing
  - Public relations
  - App and ecosystem marketing
2. **Selling tactic**: What the startup does to convince the visitor or user to become a paying customer.
  - Simple purchases
  - Discounts and incentives
  - Free trial
  - Freemium
  - Pay-for-privacy
  - Free-to-pay
3. **Revenue model**: How the startup extracts money from its visitors, users, or customers.
  - One-time transaction
  - Recurring subscription
  - Consumption charges
  - Advertising clicks
  - Resale of user data
  - Donation
4. **Product type**: What the startup does in return.
  - Software
  - Platform
  - Merchandising
  - User-generated content
  - Marketplace
  - Media/content
  - Service
5. **Delivery model**: How the product gets to the customer.
  - Hosted service
  - Digital/physical delivery

## Ecommerce

### Overview
- In an e-commerce company, a visitor buys something from a web-based retailer. This is perhaps the most common kind of online business, and it's certainly the one that the majority of traditional analytics tools are aimed at.
- Early e-commerce models consisted of a relatively simple "funnel": a visitor arrived at the site, navigated through a series of pages to get to a particular item, clicked "buy", provided some payment information, and completed a purchase.
- But modern e-commerce is seldom this simple:
  - The majority of buyers find what they're looking for through search rather than by navigating across a series of pages. Shoppers start with an external search and then bounce back and forth from sites they visit to their search results, seeking the scent of what they're after. Once they find it, on-site navigation becomes more important. This means on-site funnels are somewhat outdated; keywords are more important.
  - Retailers use recommendation engines to anticipate what else a buyer might want, basing their suggestions on past buyers and other users with similar profiles. Few visitors see the same pages as one another.
  - Retailers are always optimizing performance, which means that they're segmenting traffic. Mid- to large-size retailers segment their funnel by several tests that are being run to find the right products, offers, and prices.
  - Purchases begin far from the website itself, in social networks, email inboxes, and online communities, making the buying process harder to track.

### Key Metrics

1. **Conversion Rate** is the percentage of visitors to your site who buy something.
  - It's simple to calculate and experiment with. You'll slice conversion rate in many ways to see what makes people more likely to buy.
  - Early on, conversion rate may even be more important than total revenue because your initial goal is to simply prove that someone will buy something.
  - Conversion rate is highly dependent on your type of e-commerce business, and whether your success will be driven by loyalty, new customer acquisition, or a hybrid of the two.

2. **Purchases Per Year** refer to the number of purchases made by each customer per year.
  - If you look at the repurchase rate on a 90-day cycle, it becomes a very good leading indicator for what type of e-commerce site you have.
  - It helps to know whether to focus more on loyalty or more on acquisition.

3. **Shopping Cart Size** is the amount of money spent on a purchase.
  - You may find that one campaign is more likely to make people buy, but another might make fewer people spend more money.
  - You'll compare the total revenue you're generating to the way in which you acquired that revenue, in order to identify the most lucrative segments of your reachable audience.

4. **Abandonment** is the percentage of people who begin to make a purchase, and then don't.
  - The number of people who abandon a funnel at each of the stages is the abandonment rate.
  - It's important to analyze it for each step in order to see which parts of the process are hurting you the most.

5. **Cost of Customer Acquisition** is the money spent to get someone to buy something.
  - You'll want to drive traffic to the site via ads, social media outreach, mailing lists, or affiliates.
  - You can use analytics tools when there are myriad channels driving traffic to the site.

6. **Revenue Per Customer** is the lifetime value of each customer.
  - It is an aggregate metric of other key numbers, and represents a good, single measure of your e-commerce business's health.

7. **Keywords and Search Terms** are terms that people look for and associate with the site.
  - For paid search, you bid against others for popular keywords in search engines like Google.
  - For unpaid search, you focus on good and compelling content that improves your ranking with search engines, and on writing copy that includes the desirable search terms your paying customers tend to use.

8. **Recommendation Effectiveness** explains how likely a visitor will add a recommended product to the shopping cart.
  - There are many different approaches to recommendations: past purchases and visitor attributes (geography, referral, clicked items, etc.)
  - How much additional revenue generated through recommendations?

9. **Virality** means of word-of-mouth sharing per visitor.
  - It has the lowest cost of customer acquisition and the highest implied recommendation from someone the recipient trusts.

10. **Mailing List Effectiveness** explains the CTRs and ability to make buyers return and buy.
  - You calculate the email CTR by dividing the number of visits you get from a campaign by the number of messages you've sent. A more sophisticated analysis of email CTR will include a breakdown of the various places where things can go wrong and a look at the eventual outcome you're after.
  - You also need to create a campaign contribution metric - basically, the added revenue from the campaign, minus the cost of the campaign and the loss due to unsubscribes.

### Key Takeaways
- It's vital to know if you're focused on loyalty or acquisition. This drives your whole marketing strategy and many of the features you build.
- Searches, both off- and on-site, are an increasingly common way of finding something for purchase.
- While conversion rates, repeat purchases, and transaction sizes are important, the ultimate metric is the product of the three of them: revenue per customer.
- Don't overlook real-world considerations like shipping, warehouse logistics, and inventory.

## SaaS

### Overview

- A SaaS company offers software on an on-demand basis, usually delivered through a website it operates.
- Most SaaS providers generate revenue from a monthly (or yearly) subscription that users pay.
- Many SaaS providers offer a tiered model of their service, where the monthly fee varies depending on some dimension of the application. This might be the number of projects in a project management tool, or the number of customers in a customer relationship management application.
- Because the incremental cost of adding another customer to a SaaS service is negligible, many SaaS providers use a freemium model of customer acquisition. Customers can start using a free version of the service that's constrained, in the hopes that they'll consume all the free capacity and pay for more.

### Key Metrics

1. **Attention** measures how effectively the business attracts visitors.
2. **Enrollment** measures how many visitors become free or trial users.
3. **Stickiness** measures how much the customers use the product.
4. **Conversion** measures how many of the users become paying customers, and how many of those switch to a higher-paying tier.
5. **Revenue Per Customer** measures how much money a customer brings in within a given time period.
6. **Virality** measures how likely customers to invite others and spread the word, and how long it takes them do so.
7. **Upselling** measures what makes customers increase their spending, and how often that happens.
8. **Uptime and Reliability** measures how many complaints, problem escalations, or outages the company has.
9. **Churn** measures how many users and customers leave in a given time period.
10. **Lifetime value** measures how much customers are worth from cradle to grave.

### Measuring Engagement

- The ultimate metric for engagement is daily use.
  - If your product isn't a daily use app, establishing a minimum baseline of engagement takes longer, and the time it takes to iterate through a cycle of learning is longer.
  - It's also hard to demonstrate enough value, quickly enough, to keep people from churning.
- When measuring engagement, don't just look at a coarse metric like visit frequency. Look for usage patterns throughout your application by analyzing data in two ways:
  - To find ways you might improve things, segment users who do what you want from those who don't, and identify ways in which they're different.
  - To decide whether a change worked, test the change on a subset of your users and compare that subset's results to others.

### Churn

- Churn is the percentage of people who abandon your service over time. This can be measured weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc., but you should pick a timespan for all your metrics and stick to it in order to make comparing them easier.
- The simple formula for churn is: `(Number of churns during period) / (# of customers at beginning of period)`. However, this formula isn't normalized for behavior and size.
- A more accurate formula averages out the number of customers in the period analyzed: `(Number of churns during period) / [(# of customers at beginning of period) + (# of customers at end of period)] / 2`
- Ultimately, the math gets really complex. There are two ways to simplify it:
  - Measure churn by cohort, so you compare new to churned users based on when they first became users.
  - Measure churn each day. The shorter the time period you measure, the less that changes during that specific period will distort things.

### Key Takeaways
- While freemium gets a lot of visibility, it's actually a sales tactic, and one you need to use carefully.
- In SaaS, churn is everything. If you can build a group of loyal users faster than they erode, you'll thrive.
- You need to measure user engagement long before the users become customers, and measure customer activity long before they vanish, to stay ahead of the game.
- Many people equate SaaS models with subscription, but you can monetize on-demand software in many other ways, sometimes to great effect.

## Free Mobile App

### Overview

- When you derive revenue for your app from other sources, the model gets complex.
- Unlike web apps, where it's easy to do A/B testing and continuous deployment, mobile apps go through the app store gatekeeper - which limits the number of iterations a company can undergo, and hampers experimentation.
- Mobile app developers make money within their apps in several ways:
  - Downloadable content (such as new maps or vehicles).
  - Flair and customization of in-character appearance and gaming content.
  - Advantages.
  - Saving time.
  - Elimination of countdown timers.
  - Upselling to a paid version.
  - In-game ads.

### Key Metrics

1. **Downloads**: How many people have downloaded the app, as well as related metrics such as app store placement and ratings.
2. **Customer Acquisition Cost**: How much it costs to get a user and to get a paying customer.
3. **Launch Rate**: The percentage of people who download the app, actually launch it, and create an account.
4. **Percent of Active Users/Players**: The percentage of users who have launched the app and use it on a daily/monthly basis (DAU and MAU).
5. **Percentage of Users Who Pay**: How many of your users ever pay for anything.
6. **Time To First Purchase**: How long it takes after activation for a user to make a purchase.
7. **Monthly Average Revenue Per User**: This is taken from both purchases and watched ads.
8. **Ratings Click-Through**: The percentage of users who put a rating or a review in an app store.
9. **Virality**: On average, how many other users a user invites.
10. **Churn**: How many customers have un-installed the app, or haven't launched it in a certain time period.
11. **Customer Lifetime Value**: How much a user is worth from cradle to grave.

### Key Takeaways

- Mobile apps make their money in a variety of ways.
- Most of the money comes from a small number of users; these should be segmented and analyzed as a distinct group. The key metric is average revenue per paying user.

## Media Site

### Overview

- It's easy to insert advertising into online content that for many companies, ad-based monetization is a fallback revenue source, which subsidizes a cheaply priced game or helps pay for the cost of operating a freemium product. if your business model most closely resembles a media site, then your primary focus is sharing advertisers' messages with viewers, and getting paid for impressions, click-throughs, or sales.
- Media sites care most of all about click-through or display rates, because those are actual revenue, but they also need to maximize the time visitors spend on the site, the number of pages they see, and the number of unique visitors, because this represents inventory - chances to show ads to visitors - and a growing reach of new people in whom advertisers might be interested.

### Key Metrics

1. **Audience and Churn**: How many people visit the site and how loyal they are.
2. **Ad Inventory**: The number of impressions that can be monetized.
3. **Ad Rates**: Cost per engagement - how much a site can make from those impressions based on the content it covers and the people who visit.
4. **Click-Through Rates**: How many of the impressions actually turn into money.
5. **Content/Advertising Balance**: The balance of ad inventory rates and content that maximizes overall performance.

### Key Takeaways

- For media sites, ad revenue is everything - but advertising may include displays, pay-per-view, pay-per-click, and affiliate models, so tracking revenues is complex.
- Media sites need inventory and desirability, which comes from content that attracts a demographic advertisers want.
- It's hard to strike a balance between having good content and enough ads to pay the bills.

[back to top](#lean-analytics)

## User Generated Content

### Overview

- In this model, you're focused on the creation of good content, which means not only posts and uploads but also votes, comments, spam flagging, and other valuable activity.
- UGC is about the amount of good content vs bad, and the percentage of users who are lurkers versus creators. This is an **engagement funnel**.

### Key Metrics

1. **Number of Engaged Visitors**: How often people come back, and how long they stick around.
2. **Content Creation**: The percentage of visitors who interact with content in some way, from creating it to voting on it.
3. **Engagement Funnel Changes**: How well the site moves people to more engaged levels of content over time.
4. **Value of Created Content**: The business benefit of content, from donations to media clicks.
5. **Content Sharing and Virality**: How content gets shared, and how this drives growth.
6. **Notification Effectiveness**: The percentage of users who, when told something by push, email, or another means, act on it.

### Key Takeaways

- Visitor engagement is everything in UGC. You track visitors' involvement in an "engagement funnel."
- Many users will lurk, some will contribute lightly, and others will become dedicated content creators. This 80/20 split exists throughout the activities you want your users to accomplish.
- To keep users coming back and engaged, you'll need to notify them of activity through email and other forms of "interruption."
- Fraud prevention is a significant amount of work for a UGC site.

## Two Sided Marketplace

### Overview

- In this model, the company makes money when a buyer and seller come together to complete a transaction.
  - The seller is responsible for listing and promoting the product.
  - The marketplace owner has a "hands-off" approach to the individual transactions.
  - The buyer and seller have competing interests. In most marketplace models, the seller wants to extract as much money as possible, while the buyer wants to spend as little as possible.
- Two-sided marketplaces face a unique problem: they have to attract both buyers and sellers.

### Key Metrics

1. **Buyer and Seller Growth**: The rate at which you're adding new buyers and sellers, as measured by return visitors.
2. **Inventory Growth**: The rate at which sellers are adding inventory - such as new listings - as well as completeness of those listings.
3. **Search Effectiveness**: What buyers are searching for, and whether it matches the inventory you're building.
4. **Conversion Funnels**: The conversion rates for items sold, and any segmentation that reveals what helps sell items.
5. **Ratings and Signs of Fraud**: The ratings for buyers and sellers, signs of fraud, and tone of the comments.
6. **Pricing Metrics**: If you have a bidding method in place, then you care whether sellers are setting prices too high or leaving money on the table.

### Key Takeaways

- Two-sided markets come in all shapes and sizes.
- Early on, the big challenge is solving the "chicken and egg" problem of finding enough buyers and sellers. It's usually good to focus on the people who have money to spend first.
- Since sellers are inventory, you need to track the growth of that inventory and how well it fits what buyers are looking for.
- While many marketplaces take a percentage of transactions, you may be able to make money in other ways, by helping sellers promote their products or charging a listing fee.

[back to top](#lean-analytics)

## What Stage Are You At

1. First, you need **empathy**.
  - You need to get inside your target market's head and be sure you're solving a problem people care about in a way someone will pay for.
  - That means getting out of the building, interviewing people, and running surveys.
2. Second, you need **stickiness**, which comes from a good product.
  - You need to find out if you can build a solution to the problem you've discovered.
  - There's no point in promoting something awful if your visitors will bounce right off it in disgust.
3. Third, you need **virality**.
  - Once you've got a product or service that's sticky, it's time to use word of mouth.
  - That way, you'll test out your acquisition and on-boarding processes on new visitors who are motivated to try you, because you have an implied endorsement from an existing user.
  - Virality is also a force multiplier for paid promotion, so you want to get it right before you start spending money on customer acquisition through inorganic methods like advertising.
4. Fourth, you need **revenue**.
  - You'll want to monetize things at this point. You're focused on maximizing and optimizing revenue.
5. Fifth, you need **scale**.
  - With revenues coming in, it's time to move from growing your business to growing your market. You need to acquire more customers from new verticals and geographies.
  - You can invest in channels and distribution to help grow your user base, since direct interaction with individual customers is less critical - you're past product/market fit and you're analyzing things quantitatively.

[back to top](#lean-analytics)

## Empathy

### Metrics

- Focus on gathering qualitative feedback through problem and solution interviews.
- Find a problem worth solving and a solution that's sufficiently good to garner early traction.
- Get out of the building and speak to at least 15 people at each interviewing stage.

### Find A Problem To Fix

- The Problem Is Painful Enough:
  - You want people to act in a way that helps your business. This requires enough discomfort with their situation that they actually do what you want.
- Enough People Care:
  - You need an addressable market. You want audiences that are homogeneous within and heterogeneous between.
- They're Already Trying To Solve It:
  - The current solution will be your biggest competitor at first, because it's the path of least resistance for people.

### Convergent and Divergent Problem Interviews

- Convergent Interviews:
  - They are directed, focused, and intended to quantify the urgency and prevalence of the problems, so you can compare the many issues you've identified.
  - They give you a clear course of action at the risk of focusing too narrowly on the problems that you think matter, rather than freeing interviewees to identify other problems that may be more important to them.
- Divergent Interviews:
  - They are much more speculative, intended to broaden your search for something useful you might go build.
  - They run the risk of giving you too many problems, or not enough similar problems, and no clarity on what to do next.

### Get Answers At Scale

- This does several things:
  - It forces you to formalize your discussions, moving from subjective to objective.
  - It tests whether you can command the attention - at scale - that you'll need to thrive.
  - It gives you quantitative information you can analyze and segment, which can reveal patterns you won't get from individual groups.
  - The respondents may become your beta users and the base of your community.
- Employ surveys and landing pages to reach a wider audience and build a stronger, data-driven case for the qualitative feedback you received during interviews.

### Validate The Solution

- Interview customers to get the qualitative feedback and confidence necessary to build a MVP.
- Continue and expand on quantitative testing through surveys and landing pages.
- Identify the riskiest aspects of the solution and what you need people to do with the solution in order to be successful.

### Measure the MVP

- Pick the One Metric That Matters.
- Identify the riskiest parts of your business and de-risk them through a constant cycle of testing and learning.
- The most important metrics will be around engagement:
  - Are people using the product?
  - How are they using the product?
  - Are they using all of the product or only pieces of it?
  - Is their usage and behavior as expected or different?
- Don't ignore qualitative analytics.
- The narrowing of your focus and value proposition through the elimination of features should have an impact on how customers respond.

### Summary

- Your goal is to identify a need you can solve in a way people will pay money for at scale. Analytics is how you measure your way from your initial idea to the realization of that goal.
- Early on, you conduct qualitative, exploratory, open-ended discussions to discover the unknown opportunities.
- Later, your discussions become more quantitative and more convergent, as you try to find the right solution for a problem.
- You can use tools to get answers at scale and build up an audience as you figure out what product to build.

[back to top](#lean-analytics)

## Stickiness

### MVP Stickiness

- The focus now is squarely on retention and engagement. You want proof that your product is becoming an integral part of your users' lives, and that it'll be hard for them to switch.
- Your top priority is to build a core set of features that gets used regularly and successfully, even by a small group of initial users.
- You need to prove two things:
  - Are people using the product as you expected? If they aren't, maybe you should switch to that new use case or market.
  - Are people getting enough value out of it?

### Iterate the MVP

- Iterations are evolutionary, pivots are revolutionary. This is one of the reasons founders get frustrated and decide to pivot repeatedly in the hopes that something will accidentally engage their users. Resist that temptation.
- As you iterate, your goal is to improve on the core metrics that you're tracking. Don't get caught tinkering and polishing. You're not fine-tuning at this point, you're searching for the right product and market.

### How To Handle User Feedback

- Plan tests ahead of time, and know what you want to learn before you get started.
- Don't talk to just anybody.
- Review results quickly as you collect data.

### The Minimum Viable Vision

- You're building a platform.
- You have recurring ways to make money.
- You've got naturally tiered pricing.
- You're tied to a disruptive change.
- Adopters automatically become advocates.
- You can create a bidding war.
- You're riding an environmental change.
- You've got a sustainable unfair advantage.
- Your marginal costs trend to 0.
- There are inherent network effects in the model.
- You have several ways to monetize.
- You make money when your customers make money.
- An ecosystem will form around you.

### Summary

- Your goal is to prove that you've solved a problem in a way that keeps people coming back.
- The key at this stage is engagement, which is measured by the time spent interacting with you, the rate at which people return, and so on. You might track revenue or virality, but they aren't your focus yet.
- Even though you're building the minimal product, your vision should still be big enough to inspire customers, employees, and investors - and there has to be a credible way to get from the current proof to the future vision.
- Don't step on the gas until you've proven that people will do what you want reliably. Otherwise, you're spending money and time attracting users who will leave immediately.
- Rely on cohort analysis to measure the impact of your continuous improvements as you optimize the stickiness of your product.

## Virality

### The Three Ways Things Spread

- **Inherent Virality** is built into the product and happens as a function of use.
  - It feels genuine, and the recipient is motivated to start using the product or service.
  - It's like an epidemic. It's not voluntary.
- **Artificial Virality** is force and often built into a reward system.
  - It comes from incentivizing existing users to tell their friends.
  - You're essentially building self-funded marketing activities into the product itself, sometimes at the expense of legitimate functionality.
- **Word-Of-Mouth Virality** is the conversations generated by satisfied users, independent of your product or service.
  - It amounts to an endorsement by a trusted advisor.

### Metrics for the Viral Phase

- **Viral coefficient** is "the number of new customers that each existing customer is able to successfully convert."
  - First calculate the invitation rate, which is the number of invites sent divided by the number of users you have.
  - Then calculate the acceptance rate, which is the number of signups or enrollments divided by the number of invites.
  - Then multiply the two together.
- With a viral coefficient above 1, the product is self-sustaining.

### Growth Hacking

- **Growth hacking** relies on a deep understanding of how parts of the business are related, and how tweaks to one aspect of a customer's experience impact others:
  - Finding a metric you can measure early in a user's lifecycle through experimentation or analysis of what good users have in common.
  - Understanding how that metric is correlated to a critical business goal.
  - Building predictions of that goal based on where the early metric is today.
  - Modifying the user experience today in order to improve the business goal tomorrow, assuming today's metric is causing a change in tomorrow's goal.
- The key to the growth hacking process is the early metric (known as a **leading indicator**):
  - Leading indicators tend to relate to social engagement, content creation, or return frequency.
  - The leading indicator should be clearly tied to a part of the business model.
  - The indicator should come early in the user's lifecycle or conversion funnel.
  - It should also be an early extrapolation so you get a prediction sooner.
  - Use segmentation and cohort analysis to find these leading indicators.

### Summary

- Virality refers to the spread of a message from existing, "infected" users to new users.
- If every user successfully invites more than one other user, your growth is almost assured. While this is seldom the case, any word of mouth adds to customer growth and reduces your overall customer acquisition costs.
- Inherent virality happens naturally as users interact with your product. Artificial virality is incentivized and less genuine. And word of mouth, while hard to create and track, drives a lot of early adoption. You need to segment users who come from all three kinds of virality.
- In addition to viral coefficient, you care about viral cycle time. The sooner each user invites another one, the faster you'll grow.
- As you grow in the Virality and Revenue stages, you're trying to find leading indicators of future growth: metrics that can be measured early in a user's lifecycle that predict or control what the future will be.

## Revenue

### Metrics

- Revenue per customer is a good indicator of business health.
- As a ratio, it helps you focus on making real decisions for your startup:
  - You'll look at CTR and ad revenue, or conversion rate and shopping cart size, or subscriptions and customer lifetime value.
  - You'll compare this to the cost of acquiring new users faster than they churn.
  - You'll work hard to get pricing right, balance the highest price with the most paying customers.
  - You'll experiment with bundles, subscription tiers, discounts, and other mechanisms to determine the best price.

### Customer Lifetime Value > Customer Acquisition Cost

- You want to spend only a fraction of revenue on acquisition if you are going to keep the lights on, hire in anticipation of growth, spend money on research, and generate a ROI.
- Balancing acquisition, revenue, and cash flow is at the core of running many business models, particularly those that rely on subscription revenue and paying to gain customers. As you play with the numbers to strike that balance, there are really 4 variables to work on:
  - The money in the bank at the outset.
  - The amount of money spent on customer acquisition each month.
  - The revenue you bring in from users.
  - The rate of churn from users.

### Market/Product Fit

- When things are not going well, try pivoting into a new market. The product isn't the problem, it's the target customer.
- Also try changing your business model, which is a completely reasonable approach to finding scale.
  - Review old assumptions about the markets you were going after with the product.
  - Understand the mechanics of various markets and business models helps you triangulate the combinations that work best.
  - Speak with 10-15 prospects in each market to validate your assumptions around their problems.
  - Look for important similarities between companies inside of a broadly defined market.

### Summary

- The core equation for the Revenue stage is the money a customer brings in minus the cost of acquiring that customer. This is the return on acquisition investment that drives your growth.
- You're moving from proving you have the right product to proving you have a real business. As a result, your metrics shift from usage patterns to business ratios.
- Think of a business as a machine that converts money into greater sums of money. The ratio of money in to money out, as well as the maximum amount of money you can put in, dictates the value of the business.
- You're trying to figure out where to focus: more revenue per customer, more customers, more efficiencies, greater frequency, and so on.
- If things aren't working, it may be easier to pivot your initial product to a new market rather than starting from scratch.
- While your goal is to grow, you should also keep an eye on breakeven, because once you you can pay your own bills you can survive indefinitely.

## Scale

### Metrics

- In this stage, you're checking whether analysts, competitors, and distributors care about you as much as your core group of initial customers does. Getting attention at scale means your product or service can stand on its own, without your constant love and feeding.
- Many of the metrics you've used to optimize a particular part of the business now become inputs into your accounting systems. Data like sales, margins, and customer support costs now help you project cash flow and understand how much investment you'll need.
- Scaling is good if it brings in incremental revenue, but you have to watch for a decrease in engagement, a gradual saturation of the initial market, or a rising cost of customer acquisition. Changes in churn, segmented by channels, show whether you're growing your most important asset - your customers - or hemorrhaging attention as you scale.

### Finding Discipline as You Scale

- Know, clearly, what assumptions underpin your fundamental business model. Then, with the approval of stakeholders, change one of them. Hand that change to the executive team: which features do you think will improve that basic assumption?
- Plan out your daily activities to test those features: have conversations with customers, run surveys, create a segment that tests the new code, try mockups. This combination of agility and methodical precision is what distinguishes great startups from stalled ones.

### Summary

- When you're scaling, you know your product and your market. Your metrics are now focused on the health of your ecosystem, and your ability to enter new markets.
- You'll look at compensation, API traffic, channel relationships, and competitors at this stage - whereas before, these were distractions.
- You need to understand if you're focused on efficiency or differentiation. Trying to do both as a way of scaling is difficult. If you're efficiency-focused, you're trying to reduce costs; if you're differentiation-focused, you're increasing margins.
- As you grow, you'll need to have more than one metric at a time. Set up a hierarchy of metrics that keeps the strategy, the tactics, and the implementation aligned with a consistent set of goals. We call this the *three threes*.

## Am I Good Enough

There are a few metric that apply to most business models:

### Growth Rate

- As you're validating your problem and solution, ask yourself whether there are enough people who really care enough to sustain a 5% growth rate - but don't strive for that rate of growth at the expense of really understanding your customers and building a meaningful solution.
- When you're a pre-revenue startup at or near product/market fit, your line in the sand should be 5% growth for active users each week, and once you're generating revenues, they should grow at 5% a week.

### Number of Engaged Visitors

- Aim for 30% of your registered users to visit once a month, and 10% of them to come daily.
- Figure out your reliable leading indicators of growth, and measure them against your business model predictions.

### Pricing Metrics

- Whatever your choice of pricing models, testing is key.
- Understanding the right tiers of pricing and the price elasticity of your market is vital if you're going to balance revenues with adoption.
- Once you find your revenue "sweet spot," aim about 10% lower to encourage growth of your user base.

### Cost of Customer Acquisition

- Unless you have a good reason to do otherwise, don't spend more than a third of the money you expect to gain from a customer (and the customers invited downstream) on acquiring that customer.

### Virality

- There's no "typical" virality for startups. If virality is below 1, it's helping lower your customer acquisition cost. If it's above 1, you'll grow. And if you're over 0.75, things are pretty good.
- Try to build inherent virality into the product, and track it against your business model. Treat artificial virality the same way you would customer acquisition, and segment it by the value of the new users it brings in.

### Mailing List Effectiveness

- Open and CTR will vary significantly, but a well-run campaign should hit a 20-30% open rate and over 5% click-through.

### Uptime and Reliability

 - For a paid service that users rely on, you should have at least 99.5% uptime, and keep users updated about outages.

### Site Engagement

- An average engaged time on a page of one minute is normal, but there's a wide variance between sites and between pages on a site.

### Web Performance

- Site speed is something you can control, and it can give you a real advantage.
- Get your pages to load for a first-time visitor in less than 5 seconds. After 10, you'll start to suffer.

## Ecommerce Lines In The Sand

- Your mileage will depend on whether you're an acquisition- or a loyalty-focused e-commerce site; on whether your buyers are buying from a tablet, a phone, or a desktop; and on a variety of other important dimensions. The only way you can deal with this is to measure, learn, and segment properly.
- If you're an online retailer, you'll get initial conversion rates of around 2%, which will vary by vertical, but if you can achieve 10%, you're doing incredibly well.
- 65% of people who start down your purchase funnel will abandon their purchase before paying for it.
- Think "search-first," and invest in instrumenting search metrics son your website and within your product to see what users are looking for and what they're not able to find.

[back to top](#lean-analytics)

## SaaS Lines In The Sand

- If you ask for a credit card upfront, expect just 2% of visitors to try your service, and 50% of them to use it. If you don't ask for a credit card, expect 10% to try, and up to 25% to buy - but if they're surprised by a payment, you'll lose them quickly.
- Try to get 20% increase in customer revenue each year. And try to get 2% of your paying subscribers to increase what they pay each month.
- Try to get down to 5% churn a month before looking at other things to optimize. If churn is higher than that, chances are you're not sticky enough. If you can get churn to around 2%, you're doing exceptionally well.

[back to top](#lean-analytics)

## Mobile Lines In The Sand

- Expect yourself to be at the mercy of promotions, marketing, and the whims of the app store environment. The app store battle can be demoralizing, but smart mobile developers use the abundance of information about competitors to see what's working, emulate their successes, and avoid their mistakes.
- Keep your initial downloads small, and aim for less than 50MB to minimize download churn.
- Pay around $0.5 for a paid install, and around $2.5 for a legitimate, organic one, but make sure that your overall acquisition cost is less than $0.75 per user. These costs are increasing, in part because large studios and publishers are getting more heavily into mobile and driving costs higher, and in part because of the crackdown on some marketing service tactics for delivering paid installs.
- Expect a significant number of downloads to never launch your application, particularly if it's a free app.
- Assume that a big chunk of the people who try your app once will never do so again - but after that initial cliff drop, you'll see a more gradual decline in engaged users. While the shape of this curve will vary by app, industry, and demographic, the curve always exists, so once you have a few data points, you may be able to predict churn and dis-engagement ahead of time.
- For a freemium model, aim for a conversion from free to paid of 2%. For a mobile application or game with in-app purchases, assume that roughly 1.5% of users will buy something.
- A good metric here is highly dependent on the type of game, but aim for an ARPDAU above $0.05 as a minimum.
- Like customer acquisition costs, customer revenue comes from your business model and the margin targets you've set. Every vertical has its own value. But in the mobile app world, if you know your ARPDAU, the number of days a user sticks around, and your cost per install, you can do the math fairly quickly and decide if you have a viable business model.
- Recognize that in a free-to-play multiplayer game, most users are just "fodder" for paying users. Early on in the user's lifecycle, identify a leading indicator in her behavior that suggests whether she's a non-player, minnow, dolphin, or whale. Then provide different kinds of in-game monetization for these four segments.
- Expect less than 1.5% review rate for paid apps, and significantly less than 1% for free apps.

## Media Site Lines In The Sand

- Your ads will get 0.5 to 2% CTR for most kinds of on-page advertising. Below 0.08%, you're doing something horribly wrong.
- You'll lose around 5% of clicks before the visitor ever gets to your site. Deal with it. If you're sticky enough, the visitor will try again.
- Learn where your most beneficial traffic comes from, and what topics it's after, and spend time cultivating a following around those sources and topics. When you run experiments, segment them by platform: Facebook fans want a different kind of content from Twitter followers.
- Media sites should aim for 90 seconds or more of engaged time on their content pages. Don't expect a higher engaged time on landing pages, though; you want people to find the content they want quickly and dig in further.

[back to top](#lean-analytics)

## User Generated Content Lines In The Sand

- There's no clear number, if a content generation function is core to the use of your application, optimize it until all your users can do it, and track error conditions carefully to find out what's causing the problem.
- You'll have a very good indicator of stickiness when site visitors are spending 17 minutes a day on your site.
- Expect 25% of your visitors to lurk, 60-70% of your visitors to do things that are easy and central to the purpose of your product or service, and 5-15% of your users to engage and create content for you. Among those engaged users, expect 80% of your content to come from a small, hyperactive group of users, and expect 2.5% of users to interact casually with content and less than 1% to put some effort into interaction.
- Expect to spend a significant among of time and money fighting spam as you become more popular. Start measuring what's good and bad, and which users are good at flagging bad content, early on - the key to effective algorithms is a body of data to train them. Content quality is a leading indicator of user satisfaction, so watch for a decline in quality and deal with it before it alienates your community.

## Two Sided Marketplace Lines In The Sand

- Measure transaction size and conversion rates to understand your buyers' behavior. Then pass this information along to sellers.
- You have insight into what is selling well. Encourage those sellers and find more like them.

## Selling Into Enterprise Markets

### Why Are Enterprise Customers Different?
- In most cases, enterprise sales involve bigger-ticker items, sold to fewer customers. That means more money from fewer sources. If you're selling a big-ticket item, this changes the game dramatically. For starters, you can afford to talk to every customer. The high sale price offsets the cost of a direct sales approach, particularly in the early stages of the sale.
- Enterprise buyers tend to more regulated. Big companies are often public companies with checks and balances. The person who pays for the product (finance) isn't the person who uses it (the line of business). Understanding this dichotomy is critical for product development and sales.
- Most orgs of any real size have developed their own software and processes, and they expect you to adapt to them. They won't change how they work: change is hard, and retraining is a cost. This can increase your deployment costs, because you have to integrate with what's already in place. It also means your products must be more configurable and adaptable, which translates into more complexity and less ease of use.
- Incumbent vendors can stall your sale significantly if they get wind of what you're planning to do just by claiming that they're going to do it too.
- Most B2B-focused startups consist of two people:
  - A domain expert knows the industry and the problem domain. He acts as a proxy for customers in the early stages of product definition. Often this person is from the line of business, and has a marketing, sales, or biz dev role.
  - A disruption expert knows the tech that will produce a change on which the startup can capitalize. She can see beyond the current model and understand what an industry will look after the shift, and brings the novel approach to the existing market. This is usually the technologist.

### The Enterprise Startup Lifecycle

**Empathy: Consulting and Segmentation**
- Consulting is a good way to discover customer needs, and it helps pay the bills. It also gives you a way to test out your early ideas, because while every customer has needs, the only needs you can build a business on are those that are consistent across a reasonably large, addressable market.
- Once you've found the problem you're going to fix, and have verified that the solution will work with your prospects and clients, you need to segment them. Not all clients are identical, so it's smart to pick a geographic region, a particular vertical, or customers who belong to just one of your sales teams. That way, you can give those early adopters better attention and limit the impact of failure.

**Stickiness: Standardization and Integration**
- Instead of an MVP, you may have a prototype, or a set of specs for which the prospect will commit to paying on delivery. This pipeline of conditional purchases reduces the cost of fundraising, because it increases the chances of success.
- Managing the tension between customization and standardization is one of the biggest challenges of an early-stage enterprise startup. If you can't get the client's users to try the product, you're doomed. And while your tech might work, if it doesn't properly integrate with legacy systems, it'll be seen as your fault, not theirs.

**Virality: Word of Mouth, Referrals, and References**
- Because enterprises don't trust newcomers, you'll rely heavily on referrals and word-of-mouth marketing. You'll make case studies from early successes, and ask satisfied users to handle phone calls from new prospects.
- Referrals and references are critical to this stage of growth. A couple of household names as customers are priceless. Enterprise-focused vendors will often provide discounts in exchange for case studies.

**Revenue: Direct Sales and Support**
- To know if you have a sustainable business, you'll also look at support costs, churn, trouble tickets, and other indicators of ongoing business costs to learn just how much a particular customer contributes to the bottom line.
- Feedback from the sales team and the support group is critical at this point, because it indicates whether your initial success is genuine, or simply a case of prospects buying into the story you're telling.

**Scale: Channel Sales, Efficiences, and Ecosystems**
- You may have channel sales through value-added resellers and distributors.
- You'll also have an ecosystem of analysts, developers, APIs and platforms, partners, and competitors that will define and refine the market.

### What Metrics Matter?

**Ease of Customer Engagement and Feedback**
- If you plan to use a direct sales org later on, this is an early indicator of what it'll be like to sell the product.

**Pipeline for Initial Releases, Betas, and PoC Trials**
- It's important to articulate the stages of your sales funnel and the conversion rates at each point along the way. The sales cycle needs to be well documented, measured, and understood after the first few sales, to see if you can build a repeatable approach.

**Stickiness and Usability**
- The usability of a disruptive solution is "table stakes" for a new entrant in today's market.
- Instrument the product to monitor user flows and be able to test new ideas in how to iteratively improve your product.

**Integration Costs**
- What's the true cost of pre- and post-sales support?
- How much customization is required?
- How much training, explaining, and troubleshooting are you doing in order to successfully deliver a product to a customer?

**User Engagement**
- Get baselines from your clients that apply to their real-world businesses before you deploy. Use this info to measure progress, helping your advocates to prove the ROI - and turning it into case studies you can share with other customers.

**Disentanglement**
- Put your high-touch customers that you acquired early on into a segment and compare them to the rest of your customers.
  - How do they differ?
  - Do they consume a fair proportion of your support resources?
  - Do their feature requests match those of all your customers and prospects?

**Support Costs**
- You'll track support metrics like top-requested features, number of outstanding trouble tickets, post-sales support, call center hold time, and so on. This will indicate where you're losing money, and whether the product is standardized and stable enough to move into growth and scaling.

**User Groups and Feedback**
- Informal interaction with existing customers can be a boon to enterprise-focused startups, and resembles the problem and solution validation stages of the Lean Startup process - only rather than validating a solution, you're validating a roadmap.
- Know what you're hoping to learn and invest in the conversations and experimental design needed to get real answers that you can turn into the right product roadmap.

**Pitch Success**
- Create marketing tools for your channel and then test them yourselves. Make cold calls with their scripts. Pitch them to new customers. Send out email form letters and test response rates.
- If you make channel collateral, tag each piece of collateral with something that identifies the channel.

**Barriers To Exit**
- A vibrant developer ecosystem and a healthy API allow customers to integrate themselves with you, making you the incumbent vendor and helping you to counter threats from competitors and new entrants.
- If you have an API, track its usage by clients. Those clients who have a lot of API activity are investing more in extending their relationship with you; those who are inactive could switch vendors more easily.
