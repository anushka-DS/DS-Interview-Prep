* Can any similarity function be used for SVM? (No, have to satisfy Mercer’s theorem)
* Logistic regression vs. SVMs: When to use which one? ( Let’s say n and m are the number of features and training samples respectively. If n is large relative to m use log. Reg. or SVM with linear kernel, If n is small and m is intermediate, SVM with Gaussian kernel, If n is small and m is massive, Create or add more features then use log. Reg. or SVM without a kernel)
* What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning?
* You are working on a time series data set. You manager has asked you to build a high accuracy model. You start with the decision tree algorithm, since you know it works fairly well on all kinds of data. Later, you tried a time series regression model and got higher accuracy than decision tree model. Can this happen? Why?(Refer :https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/09/40-interview-questions-asked-at-startups-in-machine-learning-data-science/)
* Running a binary classification tree algorithm is the easy part.

* How Deep Learning tackles the curse of dimensionality?
* Why do RNNs have a tendency to suffer from exploding/vanishing gradient? How to prevent this? (Talk about LSTM cell which helps the gradient from vanishing, but make sure you know why it does so.
