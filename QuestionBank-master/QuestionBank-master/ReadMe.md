# Data Science Resources (Mostly Free)

The first half is more or less my learning path in the past two years while the second half is my plan for this year. I tried to make a balance between comprehension and doability. For more extensive lists, you can check [Github search](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=awesome+machine+learning&type=) or [CS video lectures](https://github.com/Developer-Y/cs-video-courses)

Hope the list is helpful, especially to whom are not in CS major but interested in data science!
