1.	What is the Central Limit Theorem and why is it important?
CLT states that if we sample from a population using a sufficiently large sample size, the mean of the samples (also known as the sample population) will be normally distributed (assuming true random sampling). What’s especially important is that this will be true regardless of the distribution of the original population.
Intuition :
When I first saw an example of the Central Limit Theorem like this, I didn’t really understand why it worked. The best intuition that I have come across involves the example of flipping a coin. Suppose that we have a fair coin and we flip it 100 times. If we observed 48 heads and 52 tails we would probably not be very surprised. Similarly, if we observed 40 heads and 60 tails, we would probably still not be very surprised, though it might seem more rare than the 48/52 scenario. However, if we observed 20 heads and 80 tails we might start to question the fairness of the coin.
This is essentially what the normal-ness of the sample distribution represents. For the coin example, we are likely to get about half heads and half tails. Outcomes farther away from the expected 50/50 result are less likely, and thus less expected. The normal distribution of the sampling distribution captures this concept.
The mean of the sampling distribution will approximate the mean of the true population distribution. Additionally, the variance of the sampling distribution is a function of both the population variance and the sample size used. A larger sample size will produce a smaller sampling distribution variance. This makes intuitive sense, as we are considering more samples when using a larger sample size, and are more likely to get a representative sample of the population. So roughly speaking, if the sample size used is large enough, there is a good chance that it will estimate the population pretty well. Most sources state that for most applications N = 30 is sufficient.
These principles can help us to reason about samples from any population. Depending on the scenario and the information available, the way that it is applied may vary. For example, in some situations we might know the true population mean and variance, which would allow us to compute the variance of any sampling distribution. However, in other situations, such as the original problem we discussed of estimating average human height, we won’t know the true population mean and variance. Understanding the nuances of sampling distributions and the Central Limit Theorem is an essential first step toward talking many of these problems.

5.	What are the assumptions required for linear regression?There are four major assumptions:
o	1. There is a linear relationship between the dependent variables and the regressors, meaning the model you are creating actually fits the data,
o	2. The errors or residuals of the data are normally distributed and independent from each other,
o	3. There is minimal multicollinearity between explanatory variables, and
o	4. Homoscedasticity. This means the variance around the regression line is the same for all values of the predictor variable.

6.	What is a statistical interaction?
Statistical Interactions
Basically, an interaction is when the effect of one factor (input variable) on the dependent variable (output variable) differs among levels of another  factor.
For example, in a pain relief drug trial, one factor is “dose” and another factor is “gender”. The dependent variable is “headache pain” (measured on a scale of 0 to 50). We can look at the findings by showing the means for each group in a table like this:

|Male	|Female
---|---|---
Placebo|	30|	10
50mg	|10|	30

If compare the “marginal means”, we can see that the average pain score for women was 20 and the average pain score for men was 20. There is no difference in headache pain between men and women. Likewise, the drug appears to have no effect on headache pain.
However, if we had stopped there, we would be missing some important findings. There is an interaction between gender and dose on headache pain. If we graph the means of each group, we can see it clearly: men have more headache pain than women unless they take the drug. There are simple effects of dose for both men and women, but the effects “wash out” one another. The result is no main effect of dose or gender. If you did not examine gender, it would appear that your drug did not work; if you did not study drug dose, you would see no difference between men and women. Examining the interaction allows us to see that the drug works – for men – AND that it causes pain in women.

This is called a “pure interaction” because there are no main effects, but there is an interaction.
More commonly seen, however, when effects occur in both (or all) conditions, but they are stronger in one condition than another. Also fairly common is an effect in one condition (or for one group), but no effect at all in another. For example, what if our same pain study resulted in the following means:

|Male	|Female
---|---|---
Placebo|	10|	10
50mg	|10|	30


![](http://icbseverywhere.com/blog/wp-content/media/2012/05/Interaction.jpg)
For men, there is no effect of the drug on headache pain. The drug causes pain in women, who would otherwise have the same amount of pain as men.

To recap, an interaction is when the effect of one variable differs among levels of another variable. When interactions are seen among continuous variables (variables with a range of values, as opposed to categories), they look a little different, but the meaning is basically the same. In the last example, difference in pain between men and women (the male average was 10, the female average was 20) are driven by the interaction with the drug.
